Cesium in MetacatUI
=========================

This document provides an overview of the planned architecture for incorporating [Cesium](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium) into MetacatUI. Cesium will be used to allow portal owners to visualize their geo-spatial data, as well as to provide an alternative to Google Maps in MetacatUI views that require a map (e.g. the data catalog view).
